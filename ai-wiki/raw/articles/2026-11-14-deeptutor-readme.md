## ✨ Key Features

DeepTutor is an agent-native learning workspace that connects tutoring, research, creation, and practice in one extensible system.

- **One runtime, many learning modes** — Chat, Quiz, Research, Visualize, Solve, Mastery Path, Reading, and more share session context while retaining purpose-built workflows.
- **A connected learning workspace** — Home, Learning, and Resources connect Chat, Books, Reading, Practice, Task Board, Calendar, and Learning notebook with shared materials, progress, and learning context.
- **Grounded knowledge and reading** — Build versioned libraries with LlamaIndex, PageIndex, GraphRAG, or LightRAG, connect external knowledge sources, and learn beside documents, video, and audio with source-linked citations.
- **Partners and subagents** — Consult live agents such as Claude Code, Codex, and Grok CLI, import past conversations, or run persistent Partners with their own memory, resources, and IM channels.
- **Inspectable memory** — L1 traces, L2 facts, and L3 synthesis make personalization visible and editable, with evidence links you can audit in the Memory Graph.
- **Extensible by design** — Add personas, built-in or community skills, MCP services, CLI apps, and generation models through one agent-native runtime.

## 🚀 Get Started

Choose the installation path that fits how you want to use DeepTutor. Terminal-based installs share one runtime home: private settings live in `data/user/settings/` under the launch directory, or under `DEEPTUTOR_HOME` / `deeptutor start --home` when set explicitly. After starting the app, configure a provider and model in **Settings → Providers** and **Language models**.

<details>
<summary><b>Desktop — macOS and Windows (Preview)</b></summary>

**Open DeepTutor** bundles Python, Node.js, and the full learning workspace, so no terminal or separate runtime installation is needed. Download published desktop builds from the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor/releases/latest), choosing the installer for your computer below.

For development previews, open a successful [Desktop Release workflow run](https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepTutor/actions/workflows/desktop-release.yml?query=branch%3Adev) and download the matching **Artifact**. These previews require GitHub sign-in and expire after seven days; published release downloads do not.

| Your computer | Download target | Installer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mac with Apple Silicon** | `macos-arm64` | Open the DMG and drag **Open DeepTutor** into **Applications**. |
| **Mac with Intel** | `macos-x64` | Open the DMG and drag **Open DeepTutor** into **Applications**. |
| **Windows x64** | `windows-x64` | Run the Setup `.exe`, or extract the portable ZIP and launch `Open DeepTutor.exe`. |

Windows preview builds are unsigned and may show a SmartScreen warning. See the [desktop guide](apps/desktop/README.md) for signing, local data, and source builds.

<details>
<summary><b>Docker — Fastest Full-App Trial</b></summary>

Run the full Web app without installing Python or Node.js:

```bash
docker run --rm --name deeptutor \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3782:3782 \
  -v deeptutor-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:3782](http://127.0.0.1:3782). The named volume preserves settings and local data; only port `3782` is required for the Web app. See the [Docker guide](https://docs.deeptutor.info/get-started/docker/) for host workspaces, local model services, reverse proxies, and production deployment.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>PyPI — Full Web App and CLI</b></summary>

Use **Python 3.11–3.14** and **Node.js 20.9+**. In the modular 1.7.0 release, `deeptutor[full]` installs the Web app and CLI; bare `deeptutor` installs core chat and the SDK.

```bash
mkdir -p my-deeptutor && cd my-deeptutor
python -m pip install -U "deeptutor[full]"
deeptutor init     # ports + LLM provider + optional embedding/search
deeptutor start    # starts backend + frontend
```
